Login Attack Game
-in order to play users must signup and sign in
-users try and figure out the admins password.
-username is always admin (for this 1st version)
-password does not use spaces
-everytime a password combination is attempted and fails, available bonus pts go up by 1pt.
  --this is every time a combination of characters fails, NOT everytime a login attempt fails
  --example:  42 people try to login with the password "123", bonus pts go up by 1pt.
              then 1 person trys to login with "456", bonus pts go up by 1pt.
-users who enter a correct password get 10pts + all currently available bonus pts
-after each guess the password is reset and moved up a level in complexity
